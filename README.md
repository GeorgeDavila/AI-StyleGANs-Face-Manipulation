# AI-StyleGANs-Face-Manipulation
We encode a face-my face to be precise-into the latent space of the StyleGANs architecture. This creates a latent vector associated with my my face. Manipulating this latent vector in the mathematical latent space of StyleGANs translates to the practical result of modifying my face based on features such as age. 

i.e. AI draws my face at different ages based on a single picture of me
